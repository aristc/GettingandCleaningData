# GettingandCleaningData
Week 4 Assignement

## Introduction
This repo contains a R script and a text file which is the ouptut of the R script.

## Raw Data
The analyzed data is called "Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set". It represents data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone.

The data can be downloaded using this link:

A full description of the dataset is available on:

## Data analysis

The data analysis script is called "run_analysis.R".

The requirements were as follows:
"You should create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following.
1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject."

## Output

The output is called "tidydata.txt". It corresponds to step 5 of the data analysis requirements.
It shows the average of each (mean/std) variable for each activity and each subject.
